# Consistent Hashing Implementation with Circular Linked List

This is a simple Go implementation of consistent hashing using a circular linked list. It aims to distribute data evenly across nodes using hash values.

## Overview

Consistent hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to ensure even data distribution and load balancing. This implementation utilizes a circular linked list to organize nodes in a hash ring, where data or resources can be mapped to nodes based on their hash values.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/consistent-hashing.git
   cd consistent-hashing
   ```

2. Build and run the program:

   ```
   go build
   ./consistent-hashing
   ```

3. Modify the code as needed for your use case.

## Code Structure

- `main.go`: Contains the main implementation of the circular linked list-based consistent hashing.
- `hash.go`: Defines the `Hasher` interface and provides a hash service using SHA-3.


## Implementation Details

- The `RingService` struct manages the circular linked list and node placement.
- The `HashService` struct provides hashing and distance calculation using SHA-3 and `big.Int`.
- Nodes are placed on the ring next to the node with the smallest distance, aiming to achieve even distribution.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find issues or want to enhance the implementation, feel free to create a pull request.
